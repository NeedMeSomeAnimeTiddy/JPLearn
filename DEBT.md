# Debt register

Known shortcuts, each with the condition that makes fixing it worth doing. Audits draft rows; the
lead numbers and files them (`.claude/audit-profile.md`, "Debt filing rule"). The older findings
table in `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 8 (`A1`..`F5`) stays where it is and is read alongside this one.

Row shape:

```
## <n>. <title>

**Recorded <date>.** What it is, where (`file:line`), and why it is not fixed now.

**Trigger:** the behaviour or count that makes it worth fixing, stated so an audit can check it.
```

A closed row stays in place, with `**CLOSED <date>**` after its title and how it closed. A trigger
that has fired and is still open is written `**Trigger - FIRED <date>:**`.

## Not debt, though it looks like it

See `.claude/audit/known-answers.md`, Part 2: each entry there names its record.
